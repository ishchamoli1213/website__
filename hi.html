Children make up one-third of all internet users globally
<br><br>
Even in countries where overall internet penetration is relatively low, usage among young people is sometimes as much as double the national average. With the rapid expansion of communication technologies shrinking the digital divide protecting children online in the world today is an urgent global priority. 
<br><br> 
 
Online abuse and exploitation most often takes place in the deep privacy of the computer, the mobile phone or any other electronic device. It can move anonymously from the private to the collective and across countries and borders, and at lightning speed.    
<br><br>

You’re online and come across something that makes you feel uncomfortable or worried. Maybe a friend from school is being bullied and you don’t know what to do. Or maybe, someone’s messages go from friendly to threatening. 
<br><br>
There are so many things to love about being connected, but the internet is also being misused and abused every day, and young people are paying the price. 
<br><br>
How do we make the internet a safer place for all of us? Here’s what you can do today: 
<br><br>
Be kind online. Support your peers by sending positive messages, a smile or a high-five. 
Share these videos to spread the word about online safety and get your friends talking. 
Check your settings and your passwords: is your password 12345? Have you shared it with a friend? Who can see what you post online? When’s the last time you reviewed your privacy settings? 
And remember, it starts with you! Don’t spread rumours or share hurtful or embarrassing stories or photos. What may seem like a harmless joke to one person can be deeply hurtful to others.
